HELLO.

COST counter = 3 $

COST total = 4 $
COST price = 5 $
COST discount = 10 $

NOTE Should loop 3 times $
SCAN (NOT (counter = 0)):
  RECEIPT "Counter: ", counter $
  COST counter = counter - 1 $
$

CONFIRM (total < 5 OR price > 5) AND discount > 0:
  RECEIPT "Total is low or price is high, and there's a discount!" $
  DISCOUNT(discount, total) $
  RECEIPT "Total after discount: ", total $
